# Diagnosis-of-Wilson-s-Disease-Using-Deep-Learning-and-Comparing-Neural-Architecture-Performance


Abstractâ€” Wilson's disease is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of copper in the liver and brain, leading to various neurological and hepatic symptoms. Diagnosing Wilson's disease typically relies on medical imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this groundbreaking research paper, we present the first-ever application of deep learning techniques to Wilson's disease MRI for the purpose of identifying a specific neurological manifestation known as "panda face." The panda face phenomenon in Wilson's disease MRI refers to a distinctive pattern of hyperintensity in the midbrain on T2-weighted images, resembling the facial features of a panda. To address this unique diagnostic challenge, we conducted a comparative study involving various deep neural networks. Our study involved the collection and preprocessing of a substantial dataset of Wilson's disease MRI scans, followed by an extensive evaluation of different deep learning architectures. We compared the performance of these models, including DETR FPN (our model) in terms of accuracy loss and IoU in detecting the panda face pattern. The results of our research provide valuable insights into the potential of deep learning for improving the accuracy and efficiency of Wilson's disease diagnosis. This innovative approach has the potential to revolutionize the field of medical imaging and enhance the early detection of Wilson's disease, ultimately leading to more effective treatments and improved patient outcomes.
